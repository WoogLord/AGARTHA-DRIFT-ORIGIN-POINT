# OVERARCH.txt
### PLOT
new recruit for military organization, get mech and climb the ranks as a pilot

they are actually evil, want to break the barrier to Hyperborea (relaeasing the monsters), and intend to control them

first find out they are evil around 4th gym, when bossfight is Hyperborean creature (meatn to assist the player, turns on them and kills them enemy in a cutscene after you beat the boss), you then fight the hyperborean creature

Player reflects on what they are doing and if its good.  This leads into Metal gear solid, pilot only stealth mission for data drive in your own base



### FREE NOT TILE BASED MOVEMENT

### OVERWORLD
- pokemon puzzles (strength etc)
- some areas are pilot only (no mechs)
	- you will leave your mech behind on the ground when you demech
- some zones limit how many mechas to bring in
- pick what mechs you want to use at the hangar/deploy point

- Ability to call in reinforcements (limit 1, increases per rank up to 5)  (GET THIS AFTER 4th GYM ENCOUNTER/FIRST HYPERBOREAN CREATURE)
	- Can have multiple loadouts like this, or allies

- combat initiated by base contact (neutral start)
- or initiated by an attack (enemy or ally advantage)

### COMBAT
- sonny style (final fantasy)
- turns are initiative based like DnD (player can respond to enemies this way)
- allies can be a squad of up to 3 or 5 or something, enemies should have the same limit (or double the limit for horde encounters)

### COMBAT SYSTEMS
- Melee vs Mage
- Swords vs Projectiles
- MANA = HEAT
- some weapons (ice type) bleed off heat better
- overheating (running out or reaching 100) refreshes your mana at the cost of one turn of action
- COOLDOWNS when you use abilities they go on cooldown, and cant be used for that many turns
- IF HEAT COST IS GREATER THAN YOUR CAPACITY, you can OVERCLOCK, and take extra turns to regen the heat (damage may be dealt too or something)

### Typing
- Fire vs ice, shadow vs light

### PROGRESSION
Acquire new weapons that do new things
- different combat styles
- elements

- level them (parts) up by using them

- pilot always levels up in combat

### CHASSIS PERKS
different chassis have weight limits (scaled by boss/ranks too)

i.e. a 50 max weight chasis becomes 75 after first rank up
but a  100 chasis becomes 150 after

weapons/equipment has a weight need
